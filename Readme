IoT Network Traffic Dataset Combiner

This repository provides a Python script for loading, preprocessing, and combining multiple IoT network traffic datasets, including UNSW-NB15, IoT-23, and IoTID20. The script ensures standardization of feature names, normalization of time-based attributes, and unification of attack labels, making it easier to analyze and train machine learning models on IoT security data.
Features

✅ Standardizes column names across different datasets
✅ Converts timestamps into a uniform format (Unix timestamp)
✅ Handles missing or inconsistent features gracefully
✅ Supports optional downsampling to balance dataset size
✅ Merges multiple datasets into a single structured CSV file

Datasets Used

UNSW-NB15
IoT-23
IoTID20
